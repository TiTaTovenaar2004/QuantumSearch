# QuantumSearch
Simulation of multi-boson and multi-fermion quantum search over arbitrary graphs containing a marked vertex. Performance analysis of each search algorithm (boson versus fermion).

# To-do
- Make 'output' attribute of bosonic/fermionic_search more logical. Output format of 'states', 'occupations' and 'success probabilities' should be intuitive. Use of these data in plot functions should be intuitive.
- Format plots so that they are uniform, have correct axis and units, and have no title.
